# EMAIL-REPORTS

A python program to collate the artifacts generated during Automated UI testing
during Bitrise builds, generate reports on the success or failure and relevant 
details regarding the same, and email them to a list of recipients based on the
settings in Bitrise Workflow.

This was developed for the [PlantTester Application](https://https://github.com/AtinAgnihotri/PlantTester),
but with a few tweaks can be used for collating any test artifacts on any android 
build on Bitrise.
